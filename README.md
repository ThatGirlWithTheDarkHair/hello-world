# hello-world
Saludos! First Project for GitHub
ASked to write a bit about myself:
I'm a blogger and sahm hoping to land back in the workforce in some capacity.
I'm interested in the tech field, and I think it would be a good career to develop.
It's nearly 2:00 AM here, so this is all I'll write for now.
